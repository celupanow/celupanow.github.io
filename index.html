                My name is Christina and I'm learning to become a full stack web developer. I have taken some
                coding classes in the past, though it's been a little while. I decided to change careers at this
                point in my life because I have always known that I'm in a dead end job. It's one I kind of just
                fell into and isn't really something I'm passionate about. I'm really enjoying web development so far.
                It's exciting to see how something so huge as the internet really works. It's something that everyone
                uses in their every day life, too. Always evolving, always problem solving, and having the chance to be
                creative are some of the reasons I've decided to enter this field.

                I live in Midvale, Utah with my cat, Cleocatra. She's an unusually small Ragdoll cat. She loves cheese
                and cuddling and meowing loudly in the small hours of the morning. So typical cat stuff.

                I have a lot of hobbies because I'm always teaching myself something new. I enjoy writing novels,
                reading,
                playing the piano, crocheting, playing video games, growing indoor and balcony plants, sketching, and
                baking, to name a few things. I love rainy days, thunderstorms, and rainbows. I collect loose leaf tea,
                fountain pens, books, and succulents. I also enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and
                spending time with my family. My mom is an artist and I often help her name her paintings. My dad just
                retired after working in the IT field for thirty something years. He encourages me to do things I would
                normally be too afraid to do, like changing my career to web development. My sister and brother-in-law
                run an online jewelry business and have two adorable daughters.
